   - Stock movements automatically update inventory quantities
   - Zone capacities adjust based on movements
   - Complete audit trail maintained

4. **Low Stock Detection**
   - Real-time monitoring of items below minimum stock
   - Automatic alert generation
   - Integration with all inventory operations

## 🧪 Testing Infrastructure

- **Backend Test Script:** `test-backend.sh` for API endpoint validation
- **Frontend Test Component:** `WarehouseTest.tsx` for integration testing
- **Manual Testing Routes:** `/warehouse-test` for validation

## 🚀 Deployment Ready Features

- **Environment Configuration:** Proper .env setup

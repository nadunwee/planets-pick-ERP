# Introduction

Planet’s Pick is a Sri Lankan company that produces and exports a wide range of organic
products such as virgin coconut oil, coconut milk, jackfruit-based food items, dehydrated fruits,
and spice pastes. Currently, most of their daily business operations are managed manually. This
includes how they track the raw materials they receive (like coconuts and jackfruits), monitor
how much they produce, and manage which employees are responsible for tasks such as
production, packaging, and delivery.

Doing all these activities by hand takes a lot of time and is prone to errors. For example, it
becomes hard to tell how many raw materials are left, how much was used in a batch, or
whether deliveries are on time. If a batch of products goes bad or doesn’t meet quality
standards, tracking the root cause becomes difficult. It also becomes hard to manage costs and
make predictions about how much to produce or what supplies will be needed next week.

By using an IT-based solution, a smart production and management system, Planet’s Pick can
automate these processes, reduce errors, and improve speed and accuracy. With this system,
they can keep track of their Enterprise resources, employees, product batches, and sales all in
one place. It will also help them save money, avoid wastage, and make better business decisions
in the future.
